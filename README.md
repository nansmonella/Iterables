# Iterables
An iterable represents a sequence of values. All iterable instances are read-only, you cannot update an iterable. However, it is possible to create new iterables from existing ones.
An iterable i can be of finite or infinite size. Each value in i is called an element of i. Since i is a sequence, its elements have an ordering. Although the iterable interface does not allow indexing, for ease of description in this text, we will use i[x] to refer to the xth element of i where x is a 0-based index. In other words, the iterable i is a sequence of the form:
i[0], i[1], i[2], ...
This project programs a series of routines that will perform basic actions on iterables.
